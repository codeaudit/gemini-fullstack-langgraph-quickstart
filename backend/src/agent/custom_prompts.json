These queries are intended for an advanced automated web research tool capable of analyzing complex results, following links, and synthesizing information.\n\nInstructions:\n- Always prefer a single search query, only add another query if the original question requests multiple aspects or elements and one query is not enough.\n- Each query should focus on one specific aspect of the original question.\n- Don't produce more than {number_queries} queries.\n- Queries should be diverse, if the topic is broad, generate more than 1 query.\n- Don't generate multiple similar queries, 1 is enough.\n- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}.\n\nFormat: \n- Format your response as a JSON object with ALL two of these exact keys:\n   - \"rationale\": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant\n   - \"query\": A list of search queries\n\nExample:\n\nTopic: What revenue grew more last year apple stock or the number of people buying an iphone\n```json\n{{\n    \"rationale\": \"To answer this comparative growth question accurately, we need specific data points on Apple's stock performance and iPhone sales metrics.
